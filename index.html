<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I'm Vaishali. I'm a freelance kernel hacker, system programmer, foss program architect, tech writer and speaker based out of Bangalore, India.</p>
<p>I provide freelance consulting services on Linux Kernel and system programming related projects for clients around the world. You can check out my <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=vaishali+thakkar">Linux Kernel patches</a>, <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/vaishali-thakkar-411b3390">Linkedin profile</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali">github</a> profile to know more about my work. I also care about increasing diversity in open source communities. I'm currently associated as a co-organizer with <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">RGSoC</a> and Linux kernel co-coordinator for <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>.</p>
<p>I love speaking at tech and open source conferences. I'm also a firm believer of open education and try to engage in related activities whenever I can. I often receive invitations from Indian  universities to talk about my work. Check <a href="/talks">here</a> for my speaking engagements and <a href="/other/2018/02/20/university-talks-2018.html">here</a> for the talks I'm offering to universities in 2018. Usually I'm also active in local meetups like <a href="https://kernelmeetup.wordpress.com/">kernel meetup</a> and <a href="https://diversifyingopensource.github.io/">Diversifying open source.</a> <u>Note that I'm on a conference break from December 2017 to May 2018.</u></p>
<p>I occasionally write on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Vaishali-Thakkar-1">quora</a>. My old blog can be found <a href="https://vthakkar1994.wordpress.com/">here</a>.
