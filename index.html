<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I'm Vaishali. I'm a freelance kernel engineer, system programmer, foss community architect, tech writer and tech speaker based out of Bangalore, India.</p>

<p>I provide freelance consulting services on Linux Kernel and system programming related projects for clients around the world. You can check out my <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=vaishali+thakkar">Linux Kernel patches</a>, <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/vaishali-thakkar-411b3390">Linkedin profile</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali">github</a> profile to know more about my work. I also care about increasing diversity in open source communities. I'm currently associated as a co-organizer with <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">RGSoC</a> and Linux kernel co-coordinator for <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer of open education and try to engage in related activities whenever I can. Usually I'm active in open source communities and local meetups like <a href="https://kernelmeetup.wordpress.com/">kernel meetup</a> in Bangalore. I occasionally write on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and make tech related <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1075669538639757312"> drawings</a>. I was used to write on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Vaishali-Thakkar-1">quora</a>. I'm not much active there these days!</p>

<p>If you want to hire me [full-time/part-time/consulting assistance] for your projects, please contact me after checking my <a href="/now">current availability.</a></p>

<p>I love speaking at conferences about open source and Linux kernel related topics, if you want to invite me to speak at your conference or take part in a panel, then check my <a href="/talks">upcoming/past</a> speaking engagements and feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>. I was also used to offer bunch of university talks and Linux Kernel workshops, although I'm not accepting any University workshop offers until June,2019 [if it requires me to travel outside of Bangalore]. Slides of all my talks, Linux kernel workshop material etc can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali/Talks">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali/Linux-Kernel-Workshop">here.</a></p>
