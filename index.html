<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I'm Vaishali. I'm a freelance kernel engineer, system programmer, foss community architect, tech writer and tech speaker based out of Bangalore, India.</p>

<p>I provide freelance consulting services on Linux Kernel and system programming related projects for clients around the world. You can check out my <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=vaishali+thakkar">Linux Kernel patches</a>, <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/vaishali-thakkar-411b3390">Linkedin profile</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali">github</a> profile to know more about my work. I also handle Linux kernel projects as a co-coordinator for <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a></p>.
<p>I am a firm believer of open education and care about building kind and diverse communities. Usually I'm active in bunch of open source communities and local meetups like <a href="https://kernelmeetup.wordpress.com/">kernel meetup</a> in Bangalore. I also care about building kind and diverse communities. I was associated as a co-organizer of <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">RGSoC</a> with Travis Foundation for 3 years.
I occasionally write on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and make tech related <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1075669538639757312"> drawings</a>. I was used to write on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Vaishali-Thakkar-1">quora</a>. I'm not much active there these days!</p>

<p>If you want to hire me [full-time/part-time/consulting assistance] for your projects, please contact me after checking my <a href="/now">current availability.</a></p>

<p>I love speaking at conferences about open source and Linux kernel related topics but I have kind of taken a break from preparing any new talks and reducing my conf travelling in 2019 so I'm no longer accepting any talk invitations for the conferences happening in 2019 [I'm still open for any panel invitations]. I was used to conduct Linux Kernel workshops in Indian universities, I'm no longer accepting invitations for the same as well. But the Linux kernel workshop material and slides of my all talks can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali/Talks">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali/Linux-Kernel-Workshop">here.</a> If you want me to invite for your conference happening in 2020, feel free to contact me via email.</p>
