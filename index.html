<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I'm Vaishali. I'm a freelance open source hacker based out of Bangalore, India.</p>

<p>I provide freelance consulting services on Linux Kernel, embedded Linux, embedded Rust and system programming related projects for clients around the world. Occassionally I also work on paid projects related to open source community management, technical writing, documentation etc. You can check out my <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=vaishali+thakkar">Linux Kernel patches</a> and <a href="https://github.com/v-thakkar">github</a> profile to get some idea about my work.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer of open education and care about building kind and diverse communities. Usually I'm active in bunch of open source communities and local meetups like Linux Kernel and Rust meetup in Bangalore. Currently I'm also associated with <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> as a (volunteer)coordinator for the linux kernel projects. I was associated as a co-organizer of <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">RGSoC</a> with Travis Foundation for 3 years.
I sometimes write on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and make tech related <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1075669538639757312"> drawings</a>. I was used to write on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Vaishali-Thakkar-1">quora</a> but I'm not much active there these days!</p>

<p>If you want to hire me [full-time/part-time/consulting assistance] for your projects, feel free to email me at me@vaishalithakkar.in.</p>

<p>I love speaking at conferences about open source, embedded systems, Linux kernel etc. I took a break from the public speaking in 2019 but if you want me to invite at your conference happening in 2020, feel free to email me. I was used to conduct Linux Kernel workshops in Indian universities, I no longer do that. But the Linux kernel workshop material and slides of my all talks can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali/Talks">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali/Linux-Kernel-Workshop">here.</a></p>
