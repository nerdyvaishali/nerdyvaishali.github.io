<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I'm Vaishali. I'm a freelance open source hacker based out of Bangalore, India.</p>

<p>I provide freelance consulting services on Linux Kernel, embedded Linux, embedded Rust and system programming related projects for clients around the world. You can check out my <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=vaishali+thakkar">Linux Kernel patches</a>, my Linkedin profile and <a href="https://github.com/v-thakkar">github</a> profile to know more about my work. I also handle Linux kernel projects as a co-coordinator for <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer of open education and care about building kind and diverse communities. Usually I'm active in bunch of open source communities and local meetups like Linux Kernel and Rust meetup in Bangalore. I was associated as a co-organizer of <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">RGSoC</a> with Travis Foundation for 3 years.
I occasionally write on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and make tech related <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1075669538639757312"> drawings</a>. I was used to write on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Vaishali-Thakkar-1">quora</a>. I'm not much active there these days!</p>

<p>If you want to hire me [full-time/part-time/consulting assistance] for your projects, please contact me after checking my <a href="/now">current availability.</a></p>

<p>I love speaking at conferences about open source, embedded Linux and embedded Rust related topics. I was used to conduct Linux Kernel workshops in Indian universities, I'm no longer do that. But the Linux kernel workshop material and slides of my all talks can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali/Talks">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nerdyvaishali/Linux-Kernel-Workshop">here.</a> If you want me to invite for your conference/meetup happening in 2020, feel free to contact me via email.</p>
