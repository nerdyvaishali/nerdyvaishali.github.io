## What I'm doing now

[Last Updated: May, 2019]

- Currently my paid time is divided between working with wonderful clients on Embedded Linux projects until the end of September, 2019. Starting from October, 2019 I'm open for new full-time career opportunities (Germany or Remote). I enjoy working on Systems, kernel and embedded Linux. So, if you or your team are hiring, feel free to contact me (bonus points if you also work on embedded Rust)!

- I usually update my tech and university speaking plans [here](http://vaishalithakkar.in/talks) (and occassionally announce it on twitter too :)).
