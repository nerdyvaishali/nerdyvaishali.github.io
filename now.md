## What I'm doing now

[Last Updated: September, 2019]

- Currently my paid time is divided between working with wonderful client(s) on Embedded Linux projects until the end of this year. I'm mostly planning to work for part-time during the last 3 months of a year. But I can be bit flexible for any interesting project. I enjoy working on Systems programming, Linux kernel, embedded Linux etc related projects. I've been quite interested in working on embedded Rust related projects recently so feel free to contact me if you think I would be a great fit to work on your related projects.

- I don't do any training for Linux Kernel, embedded Linux or related subjects at the moment. So, if you will contact me regarding the same, you may not get any response from me(unless we've known eachother personally before). If at any point, I'll decide to do that, the information will be available on this website. 

- I usually update my tech and university speaking plans [here](http://vaishalithakkar.in/talks) (and occassionally announce it on twitter too). I love talking about embedded systems, Linux Kernel, embedded Rust and open source ecosystem/community. If you want me to speak at your conference in 2020, feel free to email me. Please note that starting from 2019, I no longer participate in diversity panels or give talks on related subjects.
