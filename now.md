## What I'm doing now

[Last Updated: April, 2020]

- I'm currently looking for working on new paid projects. I'm mostly interested in working on embedded rust, linux kernel and/or embedded linux related projects. But I also like to work on short(or possibly long) gigs related to open source community management or technical writing. So, if you think I can help you with any of your projects, feel free to email me at me@vaishalithakkar.in.

- I don't do any training for Linux Kernel, embedded Linux or related subjects at the moment. So, if you will contact me regarding the same, you may not get any response from me(unless we've known eachother personally before). If at any point, I'll decide to do that, the information will be available on this website. 

- I usually update my tech and university speaking plans [here](http://vaishalithakkar.in/talks) (and occassionally announce it on twitter too). I love talking about embedded systems, Linux Kernel, embedded Rust and open source ecosystem/community. If you want me to speak at your conference in 2020, feel free to email me.
