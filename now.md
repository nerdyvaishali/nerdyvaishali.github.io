## What I'm doing now

[Last Updated: September 12, 2018]

- Currently my paid time is divided between working with wonderful clients on Embedded Linux projects and handling [RGSoC](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) as a co-organizer.

- In the ideal situation, I like to work on 2 parallel projects. One which involves technical work in the Linux kernel (and related projects) and another which can involve community, diversity related projects/programs. Starting from October, I'm looking for new challenging work for community related positions in open source projects which can require me to work for 10-15 hours/week.

- I usually update my tech and university speaking plans [here](http://vaishalithakkar.in/talks) (and occassionally announce it on twitter too :)).
