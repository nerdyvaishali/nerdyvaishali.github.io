## What I'm doing now

[Last Updated: August, 2019]

- Currently my paid time is divided between working with wonderful clients on Embedded Linux projects until the end of September, 2019. Starting from October, 2019 I'm open for new full-time career opportunities (Germany or Remote). I enjoy working on Systems, kernel and embedded Linux. So, if you or your team are hiring, feel free to contact me (bonus points if you also work on embedded Rust)!

- I don't do any training for Linux Kernel, embedded Linux or related subjects at the moment. So, if you will contact me regarding the same, you may not get any response from me. If any point, I'll decide to do that, the information will be available on this website. 

- I usually update my tech and university speaking plans [here](http://vaishalithakkar.in/talks) (and occassionally announce it on twitter too). I love talking about embedded systems, Linux Kernel, embedded Rust and open source ecosystem/community. If you want me to speak at your conference in 2020, feel free to email me. Please note that starting from 2019, I no longer participate in diversity panels or give talks on related subjects.
