## What I'm doing now

[Last Updated: May 9, 2018]

- Currently my paid time is divided between working with wonderful clients on Embedded Linux projects and handling [RGSoC](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) as a co-organizer.

- I'm also going to spend 3-5 hours/week on Embedded Rust project as part of ['Increasing Rust's Reach'](http://reach.rust-lang.org/) program from May 15, 2018.

- Until August, 2018, I'm not looking for any technical/community/advisory work. But if you have any projects coming up in/after August, 2018 which requires me to work for 25 hours/week or less and you think I'd be great fit for, feel free to drop me an email at <a href="mailto: me@vaishalithakkar.in">me@vaishalithakkar.in</a>. Iâ€™m almost always happy to follow up with a free consultation via video/audio/text chat for projects I'm really interested in.

- I usually update my tech and university speaking plans [here](http://vaishalithakkar.in/talks) (and occassionally announce it on twitter too :)).
