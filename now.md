## What I'm doing now

[Last Updated: November 12, 2018]

- Currently my paid time is divided between working with wonderful clients on Embedded Linux projects. So, I'm not looking for any paid work until the end of May, 2019.

- I usually update my tech and university speaking plans [here](http://vaishalithakkar.in/talks) (and occassionally announce it on twitter too :)).
